# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance structure for the Radiant Flow Imaging Hub (EHR Wallet) project. It defines how decisions are made, how contributors can become maintainers, and how the project is managed.

## Project Structure

The EHR Wallet project follows a meritocratic, consensus-based governance model. The project is led by a group of maintainers who have demonstrated both technical expertise and community leadership.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Contributors
- Anyone who contributes code, documentation, issues, or other content to the project
- Have read access to the repository and can submit pull requests
- Can participate in discussions and provide feedback

#### Maintainers
- Have write access to the repository
- Review and merge pull requests
- Triage issues
- Guide technical direction
- Mentor contributors
- Represent the project in public forums

#### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
- Consists of senior maintainers and key stakeholders
- Makes high-level technical and architectural decisions
- Resolves disputes when consensus cannot be reached
- Sets project roadmap and priorities
- Approves new maintainers

## Decision Making Process

The EHR Wallet project aims to operate by consensus, particularly for technical decisions. The process works as follows:

### Day-to-Day Decisions
- Routine decisions are made through pull request reviews and discussions
- Maintainers review changes and approve or request modifications
- At least one maintainer approval is required to merge a pull request
- No explicit objections from other maintainers for 72 hours is considered implicit approval

### Significant Changes
For significant changes (architectural changes, new features, policy changes):
1. A proposal is submitted as a GitHub issue or pull request
2. The proposal is discussed in community meetings and on GitHub
3. Maintainers seek consensus through discussion
4. If consensus is reached, the proposal is accepted
5. If consensus cannot be reached, the TSC makes the final decision by majority vote

### Voting
When voting is necessary:
- Each TSC member gets one vote
- Decisions require a simple majority (more than 50%)
- Voting period lasts for one week
- Votes are cast publicly in GitHub issues or pull requests

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who consistently demonstrate commitment, expertise, and good judgment may be invited to become maintainers.

### Criteria for Maintainership
- Sustained contributions over time (code, documentation, reviews)
- Technical expertise in relevant areas
- Understanding of project goals and direction
- Positive interactions with the community
- Demonstrated good judgment in technical decisions

### Process
1. Existing maintainer nominates a contributor
2. TSC discusses the nomination
3. If consensus is reached, an invitation is extended
4. New maintainer is granted repository write access
5. Announcement is made to the community

## Technical Steering Committee

### Composition
- Initially consists of the project founders
- Expands to include senior maintainers and key stakeholders
- 3-7 members, with odd number preferred for voting purposes

### Selection
- New TSC members are nominated by existing members
- Requires unanimous approval from current TSC
- Members serve until they step down or are removed

### Meetings
- TSC meets monthly
- Meetings are open to the community as observers
- Meeting notes are published publicly

## Project Releases

- Release schedule is determined by the TSC
- Major releases require TSC approval
- Minor releases can be approved by maintainers

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the EHR Wallet community are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The TSC is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct and addressing violations.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document require:
1. Proposal submitted as a pull request
